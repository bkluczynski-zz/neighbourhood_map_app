# Neighbourhood App Udacity Final Project

### Project's aim was to build an app that would allow a user to browse through the preselected set locations and having them displayed on a Google Map as a set of markers, that a user can later interact with by clicking on one of the markers and seeing a popup info window presenting a short description of the location provided by Wikipedia - obtained through an API call to mediaWiki API.

### App has been built with Knockout organisational framework to facilitate tracking of changes of state across the app.

#### How to run the app?

- Clone this repo
- Open index.html in a browser
- Select one of markers by clicking on one of them directly or select one of locations from the list to activate an info window of a chosen marker
